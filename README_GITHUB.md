### You need to get the FirebaseAPI keys from me. Email me at hunter.white1801@gmail.com

Not having API keys will result in the app loading a blank screen and/or errors.

# Getting Started:

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Make sure you have both [Expo](https://expo.dev/tools) and [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio) with a virtual device setup.
2. run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm start`
4. Press the "A" key on the keyboard to open up the app on your android device.

Note: this app was developed on Android. Unknown issues may occur on iOS.
